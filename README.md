# Linear-Regression
A playground for messing around with linear regressions

As a very basic first starting point, we are using `data_transform.py` to take some csv files some [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/) and pre-process them such that we have our first column as the TB cases in a given country in a given year and the second column as the life expectancy in the aforementioned (country, year) pair. We then use `main.py` to apply a linear regression model to the outputted data and then test that model (obviously using different data to the training data). We then plot the results
